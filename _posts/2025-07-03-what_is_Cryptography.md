## What is Cryptography?
  - A very basic and classical goal of Cryptography is enabling secret 
communication between two parties, even in the presence of an adversary.
  - In the early days (before 1960), this was achieved through various 
mathematical tricks and methods that were often not very scientific in
nature. 
  - In contrast, modern cryptography is grounded in a solid mathematical 
foundation and is regarded as a branch of engineering that lies at the 
intersection of mathematics and computer science.
